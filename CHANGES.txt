  - first release, provide basic HTTP Get and Post, and data extraction base on Jericho HTML Parser
  - support Maven


2010-03-09      0.2
  - upgraded dependency library including groovy, apache http core/client, log4j etc.
  - remove @Delegate methods from http. i.e. the Http instsance won't have the HttpEntity and HttpResponse methods
    anymore. It is because HttpResponse has a getEntity method that override the getEntity of the base Http class. And
    response delegate is also removed for code consistency.
